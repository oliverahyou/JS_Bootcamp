    <h1 id="thelions">The lions</h1><hr>
    <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
      savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal
      than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night
      and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related
      females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20
      adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate
       when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope,
       deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.</p>
