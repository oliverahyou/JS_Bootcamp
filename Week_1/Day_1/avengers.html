    <h1>Doctor Strange</h1>
    <p>As Master of the Mystic Arts and Sorcerer Supreme, Dr. Stephen Vincent
       Strange, M.D., is typically considered Earth's foremost expert on magic.
       But this was not always the case. Earlier in his life, he was a
       professional surgeon who had been infamous for his arrogance. But then
       he was involved a car crash that so injured his hands that it stripped
       him of his fine motor skills, and when that happened, he became
       desperate to regain them and searched the globe for a cure, squandering
       a fortune to that end. And one was offered to him--not to cure his hands,
       but instead to cure his soul.</p>
